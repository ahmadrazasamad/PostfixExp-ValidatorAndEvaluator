# Postfix Expression Validator and Evaluator
This repository contains a C++ program that validates and evaluates postfix expressions using a stack-based approach. The program checks for the correctness of the postfix expression, handles various operators, and computes the final result if the expression is valid.
## Features
- <b>Validation:</b> Ensures the postfix expression has a valid balance of operands and operators.
- <b>Evaluation:</b> Computes the result of the postfix expression using a stack.
- <b>Error Handling:</b> Detects and reports errors such as insufficient operands, division by zero, and invalid characters.
- <b>Support for Multi-Digit Numbers:</b> Accurately processes expressions with multi-digit operands.
## Supported Operators
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Exponentiation (^)
## How It Works
1. Input: The user is prompted to enter a postfix expression.
2. Validation: The program validates the expression by checking if there are enough operands for every operator and ensuring there are no invalid characters.
3. Evaluation: If the expression is valid, it is evaluated using a stack, and the result is displayed. If the expression is invalid, an error message is shown.
## Example
```
Enter a postfix expression: 6 2 / 3 4 * + 2 ^ 3 +
The postfix expression: '6 2 / 3 4 * + 2 ^ 3 +' is valid.
The result evaluated of this postfix expression: '6 2 / 3 4 * + 2 ^ 3 +' is 4096
```
